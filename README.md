# IC50-Calculations-for-Dose-dependent-Data
IC50 values (half-maximal inhibitory concentration values) are key quantitative measurements taken for drug-like compounds in medicinal chemistry. Here, I provide a simple algorithm to estimate and output different types of IC50 values from dose-dependent data. 

Specifically, this script is tailored for Octet 364 Bioassay data in excel documents. Time-series data from the excel file is extracted and integrated for AUC IC50s (association and dissociation field IC50s) are also provided. 

If you are not using Octet RED 364 instrument, then this script can still be used for general sigoidal regression for IC50 determination from single point (concentration, signal) type data.
