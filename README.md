# IC50-Calculations-for-Dose-dependent-Data
IC50 values (half-maximal inhibitory concentration values) are key quantitative measurements taken for drug-like compounds in medicinal chemistry. Here, I provide a simple algorithm to estimate and output different types of IC50 values from dose-dependent data.
